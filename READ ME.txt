This python program currently have all the functions of the first part with the features to be developped. All the functionalities are displayed clearly once you run the code :

To run the code properly make sure to have all the files in the zip files in the same folder otherwise the program will not find the path to it.
After that all you have to do is run the code and select in the menu given the functionalities that you want to test.
The default directory is said to be to the cleaned directory since it's the one we are mainly working with.
For the first part (features functions): for some functions that uses singular files it is necessary to give manually the files that you want to test.
WATCH OUT for the spelling since if it's not perfectly matching, the code will show an error.
For the second part (chatbot): just select second option when running the main program then enter your question.
